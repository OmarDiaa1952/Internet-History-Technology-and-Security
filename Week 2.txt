Question 1
What was the primary reason for the development of store and forward networks by the academic community?
>>
By breaking the communication into shorter leased lines, and stopping at many universities along the way, overall cost was minimized.

Question 2
What is the relationship between the number of hops on the store and forward network, and the time taken for a message to be delivered?
>>
More hops within the network usually result in a longer delivery time

Question 3
What were the primary motivations for the Department of Defense to develop the research network ARPANET?
>>
To improve computing equipment for military purposes, making it easier for people to access computers, and communicate more effectively across the military.

Question 4
What was the fundamental difference between the store and forward network of BITNET, and ARPANET?
>>
Packet switching

Question 5
In the shared network, the role of the router is:
>>
To quickly forward packets to the next router

Question 6
What are the advantages of packet switching?
>>
Many messages can be in-flight at the same time, preventing large messages from blocking small ones

Question 7
Why did the National Science Foundation decide to build a national shared network?
>>
It was very expensive to give each university its own supercomputer. A national shared network was more affordable.

Question 8
Larry Smarr was one of many instrumental players in creating the first national network. What do we learn from his interview?
>>
That high performance computing needs at universities and the Internet were deeply connected.

Question 9
Why did the University of Michigan not participate in the ARPANET research project?
>>

Michigan had its own state-wide network, consisting of 3 nodes

Question 10
In the late 1980s, how did the first average citizens get Internet access?
>>
First the 'academic-only' rules were quietly ignored and then later the 'academic-only' rules were removed completely

Question 11
What was the primary difference between the University of Michigan proposal to build the NSFNet, and the other proposals?
>>
The University of Michigan Proposal used partnerships to deliver $55Million of value for $15M of NSF funds awarded.
