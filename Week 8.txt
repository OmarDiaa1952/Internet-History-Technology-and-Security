1. Which of the following is true of security?
>>
Perfect security is achievable and requires a trade-off with cost

2. What is the difference between active and passive wiretapping?
>>
In passive wiretapping the network is snooped whereas in active wiretapping the network data is altered

3. Integrity is preserved if
>>
The information you receive is from who you think it is and has not been modified since it was sent

4.  Which of the following factors has the smallest effect on the strength of a cryptosystem?
>>
The data being transmitted

5. What is one possible advantage of public-key cryptosystems over secret-key ones?
>>
Public-key cryptosystems do not have the problem of secure key distribution

6.What does it mean if a cryptosystem is symmetric-key in nature?
>>
The key used for encryption is not the same as the key used for decryption

10. What does a cryptographic hash function do?
>>
It takes a block of data and returns a fixed-size bit string called the hash value
