1. Common Link Layer technologies are… (Choose all that apply)
>>
WiFi
Optical
Satellite
Ethernet
Cable Modem
DSL

2. When looking at addresses form most general to most specific, we read IP addresses ________ and we read domain addresses _________. (fill in the blanks)
>>
left to right, right to left

3. When do wireless devices receive their serial numbers (i.e. MAC or Ethernet addresses)?
>>
When they are manufactured

4. What does the time taken for a packet to reach a destination usually reflect?
>>
The speed of light and the distance the packet has to travel

5. How do wireless devices operating on a shared network determine when to send information so as not to incur chaos?
>>
They listen to the sound on the current network, and send information when it is quiet.

6. What is the concern when deciding which device sends information next on Ethernet?
>>
Ensuring fairness – that one type of device, data, or user is not preferred over others.

7. What is the maximum possible number of hops a packet can take to try to reach their destination (the so-called “Time To Live” functionality of packets)?
>>
255

8. What are Router Tables?
>>
Dynamic lists of directions for where and how to direct packets

9. What are the layers, and in what order do we structure them?
>>
Application Layer
Transport Layer
Internetwork Layer
Link Layer

10. What is the Internet Protocol Layer responsible for?
>>
Getting a packet to a specific network address

11. How is an IP address determined?
>>
Geographically

12. The prefix of an IP address determines what?
>>
The network that it belongs to

13. What is the Link Layer responsible for? (Choose all that apply)
>>
Deciding on the next link that a packet should be sent on once it is inside of a router

14. Is it possible to track a packet’s journey across the network?
>>
Yes, using a technique called ‘traceroute’ which tracks the packets that are returned due to transmission failure.
